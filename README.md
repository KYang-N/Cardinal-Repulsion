# Sensory-Memory Interactions in Visual Working Memory

This repository contains the MATLAB code necessary to replicate the figures from the research article _Sensory-memory interactions via modular structure explain errors in visual working memory_, published in *eLife*. You can read the full paper [here](https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/95160).

## Overview
The code in this repository implements the simulations and analyses presented in the paper. By running these scripts, you can reproduce all the figures in the manuscript.

## Setup Instructions

To run the simulation and replicate the figures:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Add the `sim_fun` folder to your MATLAB path:
   ```matlab
   addpath('path_to_sim_fun_folder');
   ```
   Replace `path_to_sim_fun_folder` with the actual path where the `sim_fun` folder is located.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (version 2022b or later recommended)
